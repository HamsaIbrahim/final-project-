                                    Welcome to our web application! Our mission is to create a platform that connects basketball players, facilitates fundraising tournaments, and helps users find local games. We're passionate about basketball and understand how important it is to have a community of individuals to play with.
 To ensure that our app meets the needs of our target audience, we conducted surveys of casual and competitive basketball players. We used this research to design a user-friendly and easily navigable platform that keeps users engaged and encourages them to spend more time on the app.
 We've carefully considered the pros and cons of various frameworks and databases, and have chosen the best options for our project. Our main objectives are to build a community for basketball enthusiasts, enable users to find regular games and teams, and create an environment where mistakes are seen as learning opportunities for personal growth. 
Our success will be evaluated through user feedback and data analysis, and we're always looking for ways to improve and make our app even better. We hope that you'll join us on this journey to create a better app for basketball players everywhere!

                                                        most importantly Highline gave me the tools and the options to

                                                        successful in the future. I do want to give a shoutout to Coach
                                                        Dawson and the rest of the coaching staff because not only did

                                                    <p>Highline was a life changing experience for me. The main reason I
                                                        accepted an offer to play at Highline was Coach Dawson. The
                                                        Highline
                                                        program has always been well respected, organized, competitive
                                                        and a
                                                        regular playoff team for their division. Coach Dawson was
                                                        someone my
                                                        parents and I felt we could trust. He didn’t sugar coat the
                                                        situation, promise me the world, and try to sell me on pipe
                                                        dreams.
                                                        We had a very strong team with 11 freshman coming in. I came
                                                        from
                                                        O’Dea High School where we won 3 out of 4 state championships
                                                        and
                                                        lost in the state championship the year we didn’t win it, so not
                                                        being apart of a winning program was not an option for me.
                                                        Highline
                                                        was the first place I ever played for that I truly felt the
                                                        coaching
                                                        staff cared about my life off the court just as much as they did
                                                        on
                                                        the court.

                                                    <p>My time at Highline meant having an opportunity to become a
                                                        better
                                                        player and most importantly a better person in general. Being at
                                                        Highline you understand the concept of family as the words on

                                                        something
                                                        a lot bigger than just yourself. You are a part of a team that
                                                        has a
                                                        reputation to be a winner; losing is not taken easily. You learn
                                                        life skills that you will be able to apply in the real world.
                                                        You
                                                        learn to truly understand what a student-athlete should be. You
                                                        are
                                                        required to perform at a high level on the basketball court and
                                                        in
                                                        the classroom. Highline taught me a lot and for that I will be
                                                        forever thankful. Highline means a lot to my development as a

                                                        and a basketball player; that is why Highline is one of the best
                                                        basketball programs in the NWAACC. I just want to say thanks to
                                                        Coach Dawson, the coaching staff and my teammates that I’ve had
